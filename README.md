This was a really fun project about creating simple and readable webpages! I learnt a lot of new skills such as placing links, headings, paragraphs and links. Furthermore, I learnt how to change the format of some texts, such as making them italicised or bold. This project has definitely inspired me and brought about an endless amount of ideas of what I can do using HTML! This project also encouraged me to familiarise myself with the practice of commiting everytime a significant change or edit was made. I am looking forward to the skills I will continue learn in the near future to come!
